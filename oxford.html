  <p>The Oxford Falls area is valued for its natural bushland and the habitat this provides for wildlife
conservation. Parts of the Oxford Fails area also include cultural sites amidst numerous lookouts and
scenic areas (eg Oxford Falls Waterfall).</p>

    <p>The area is popular with cyclists and walkers and provides ready access
Sydney's northern beaches between Narrabeen and Manly, the Narrabeen lagoon as well as the
adjoining Garigal National Park. The area may also afford potential sites to accommodate wellintegrated,
either low key or intensive development.
The majority of attractions within the Oxford Fails area are on Crown land that is either administered by
the Department of Lands or under the control and management of Warringah Council.</p>

    <p>Middle Creek (not to be confused with Middle Harbour Creek) makes two drops into the valley of picturesque Oxford Falls Recreation Reserve where Oxford Falls Road fords the creek at Oxford Falls. Though the falls are the highest in the Sydney metropolitan region, there is no viewing platform, and the only way to see them is from the head of the falls looking over the top or from the valley below which is dense bushland.</p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Alexander Bowen was granted 200 acres (0.81 km2) here in 1878, which he named Bloodwood Gully. Oxford Falls was changed as the name of the suburb in 1902. Wakehurst Parkway is named after John de Vere Loder, 2nd Baron Wakehurst, the Governor of New South Wales (1937â€“1946).</p>

    <h2>Mountain Biking</h2>
    <p>In general, mountain biking is permitted on fire trails, but not on walking tracks. Some fire trails are being regenerated, so it is not always clear where mountain biking is permitted. Two of the best areas for mountain biking in Sydney are located near the edge of the park at Oxford Falls and Red Hill. These are a mix of fire trails and single track, of all levels of difficulty. The Oxford falls tracks start from Morgan road, extending deep down into Garigal National Park.

    <p>The Oxford Falls downhill and dirt jumps are suited to advanced mountainbike riders. The tracks include wooden drops, rocky downhill sections and gigantic dirt jumps. Many people ride there everyday, with no age limit. There is a large mountan biking community on Oxford Falls, because of the diversity of tracks for all skill levels.</p>

<h2>Oxford Falls Waterfall</h2>
<p>Oxford falls waterfall is the largest waterfall in the Sydney Metropolitan area, and by far the most stunning. It is unkown to most of the public, Because they are oblivious to the hidden track which descends the steep cliffside down to the cave at the bottom of the waterfall, which flows into a deep pool.</p>

<h3>How to get to Oxford Falls Waterfall</h3>
<p>Sadly, there is no public transport access to the waterfall, which makes it hard to access if a motor vehicle is unavailable. The closest bus stop to the Waterfall is Forest Way Shopping Centre, Frenchs Forest. The nearest train station from Forest Way Shopping Centre is Chatswood train station, which you will get a bus from the interchange to Forest Way Shopping Centre.</p>

 Walk along the rock until you reach the cliff edge. Be careful as it is very high and easy to slip. At the clif edge you should see this puddle.

<p>The next step is to walk straight along a thin dirt track until you see a rock step, about 1m high. Do not take the right turn as that is a dead end. You keep walking until you reach another rock step, this time bigger. Use the trees to help yourself get down. Keep walking until you see the water and you will turn left onto the cave</p>

    <p>Once you arrive at the bottom of the track you will see this magnificent waterfall and cave. There are many spots to have a picnic, campfire or just to laze around and watch the calm water flow into the pool. There is a sandy beach which is good where there has not been much rain. There is alot of plastic pollution from decades ago at the bottom of the waterfall from big storms in the 1970's washing plastic down the waterfall and left to build up in the bush. We need your help to clean it up.</p>

    <h2>Oxford Falls Coins</h2>
    <p>In January 2016, I was walking in the buh in Oxford Falls, when I found a clearing. I walked over and saw hundreds of old and rusty trucks, and large sandstone blocks. I walked over to this blue wheelbarrow, and saw all these old coins in there</p>
