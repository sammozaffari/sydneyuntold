    <h3>Why did I make this site? </h3>
    
        I made this site because I wanted to show people the places I have found in Sydney, and the experiences that I have had. I am a 15 year old student from <a class="link" http://www.killarney-h.schools.nsw.edu.au/">Killarney Heights High School</a></p>
    
    <p>I love taking photos and trying to visually describe a story or subject. Ever since I was 10, I was exploring in the bush in Oxford Falls behind my house, trying to find places of interest and places to photograph. From 7 years old I have had a youtube channel, making videos and edits, constantly uploading and learning more </p>
    
    <p>When I got my first real dslr when I was 12, thats when I really got into photography. At Killarney I have photographed events like cross country and the swimming carnival, also taking video. I think doing these things for school is fun.</p>
    
    <p>I had been thinking of this idea for and while, and thought it would be cool to make an explorer guide to the unkown places in Sydney, the secret areas. Everytime I am exploring or finding a new place, I always have my camera with me, to take photo and video, to document the location, and importantly, how to get there. I plan to add more content to this website about the many more locations that I have found, with descriptive content. I enjoy skating, bike riding and surfing.</p>
